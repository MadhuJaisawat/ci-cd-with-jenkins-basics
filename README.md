# ci-cd-with-jenkins-basics
This repository contains my learning and hands-on practice with Jenkins as a Manual QA tester transitioning towards automation and CI/CD.

I am learning Jenkins to understand how test execution can be automated and integrated into continuous integration pipelines.

Topics covered:
Jenkins basics and architecture
Installation and setup on Windows
Understanding jobs, builds, and pipelines
How Jenkins supports automated testing
Basic CI concepts for QA testers

This repository focuses on concepts, notes, and screenshots from hands-on practice rather than production-level pipelines.
