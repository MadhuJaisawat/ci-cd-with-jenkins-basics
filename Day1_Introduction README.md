What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation tool used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. It helps teams automatically build, test, and deploy applications.

Why Jenkins is important for QA?
As a tester, Jenkins helps us run automated test cases automatically whenever new code is deployed. This reduces manual effort and finds bugs early.

Real-life example:
Whenever a developer pushes new code, Jenkins can automatically trigger test cases instead of testers running them manually every time.
