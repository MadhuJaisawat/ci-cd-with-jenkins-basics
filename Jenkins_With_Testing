How Jenkins helps me as a tester:
Jenkins can be configured to trigger automation scripts.
It supports tools like Selenium, PyTest, and TestNG.
Test reports can be generated automatically after execution.

Steps :
(1) Developer commits code
(2) Jenkins triggers build
(3) Automation tests run
(4) Report is generated
(5) Tester reviews results
